# Lobster-closedAreas-Flexdash

This app displays areas closed to spiny lobster trap fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. It includes a geolocation function linked to observers that inform the user if their location is out of, near, or in a closed area and cause the colors of closed area and buffer polygons to change accordingly.
