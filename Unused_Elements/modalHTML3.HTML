                <p><font color="white">The use of this application is pretty self-explanatory, but to get you started, here are some of the details.</font></p>
                <p><font color="white">When you enable geolocation (using the little button under the zoom controls), your coordinates will be identified and a red circle will drop on the map indicating where you are.  If you just want to explore the closed areas, but are not in their vicinity, <b>don't</b> click the geolocation button. If you'd like to the site to stop locating you, you can click the geolocation button again to turn it off.  Areas closed to spiny lobster trap fishing activities will start out</font> <font color="yellow">yellow</font><font color="white">, as long as you stay out of those areas they will stay <font color="yellow">yellow</font>.  If you get within a kilometer (about 3000 feet) of a closed area, a new popup will appear that says ‘Warning: you are nearing a closed area’ and a <font color="#654321">brown</font> shape will appear surrounding the closed area polygon.  When you enter a closed area, the polygon will turn <font color= "#e7298a">pink</font><font color="white"> and another popup will appear stating ‘You’re in a closed area, no lobster trap fishing activities are allowed here’.  You can close these popups by clicking the little x in the upper right hand corner. </p>
		<p>Now that the app logistics are out of the way, you’re probably wondering why these areas are closed in the first place.  In 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed a Biological Opinion of the Spiny Lobster Fishery which concluded that spiny lobster trap fishing activities put sea turtles, smalltooth sawfish, and staghorn and elkhorn corals at risk.  The Gulf and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils took action to address the concerns outlined in the Biological Opinion, and in an effort to protect threatened staghorn and elkhorn corals, closed areas were created in federal waters off the Florida Keys that were identified as containing colonies for these coral species.  Transitting is allowed through these areas, but spiny lobster trapping is prohibited.</p>
